### Line Structure in Python
>口 Python code is divided into __logical lines__.

>口 Every line is ended by a token called newline.(i.e) Python uses new lines to complete a command.\
  (as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses).

>口 Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope (a block of code); such as the scope of 
   loops,functions and classes.\
   (unlike other programming languages that often use curly bracket for this purpose).


→ So a single __logical line__ can consist of one or more __physical lines__.\
→ we can add 2 __physical lines__ into 1 __logical line__ by using \ 

    a = 1\
    + 2
    
→ we can also have 2 __logical lines__ in 1 __physical line__ using ;

    x = 1 ; y = 2

### Python Indentation

>• __Indentation__ refers to the __spaces__ at the beginning of a code line.\
>• Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\
>• Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.\
>• You have to use the __same number of spaces__ in the same block of code,\
   otherwise Python will give you an error.
